## General Info


Lung nodules are a frequent and important finding in chest computed tomography (CT) scans, especially in the context of lung cancer screening. Early detection and precise measurement of nodules are critical for clinical decision-making. In this project, we present `medimgx`, a lightweight Python library for reading 3D chest CT images, applying clinical windowing, running pretrained segmentation models, and quantifying pulmonary nodules.


This toolkit supports DICOM-format image series and includes a fully executable pipeline for preprocessing, inference, and visualization. It is designed to be modular, testable, and reusable for future research in medical imaging.

## Requirements and Setup


This repository requires a local setup with medical image data and a pretrained segmentation model. The sample input is a chest CT series in **DICOM format**, typically consisting of axial slices from a lung scan.


You will need:
A DICOM CT scan (e.g., from [LIDC-IDRI](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/lidc-idri/)
A pretrained PyTorch segmentation model (e.g., `lung_nodule_segmentor.pt`)
Python 3.8+ with required packages listed in `requirements.txt`


 **Note**: This project does **not** include any patient data or pretrained model by default.


### 1. Download and Prepare Input Data


Download a chest CT scan in DICOM format and place the slice files in the following directory:


```
sample_data/lung_series/
```


If using public data (e.g., LIDC-IDRI), extract a single patient study with axial slices in `.dcm` format.


### 2. Pretrained Model


Place your PyTorch model (e.g., a 3D UNet trained for lung nodule segmentation) in the root directory:


```
lung_nodule_segmentor.pt
```


> You can train your own model or request a demo model from the authors.



### 3. Install Dependencies


To install Python library:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yumm123/BIOSTAT821-Final-MIP.git@main
```




## Workflow


The following steps describe the end-to-end pipeline for loading CT images, predicting lung nodules, and computing volume statistics.


### 1. Image Loading and Preprocessing


~~~
python examples/predict_nodule.py
~~~


**Arguments**: (configured in script or CLI)


- `dicom_path` : Path to folder of DICOM slices
- `model_path` : Path to pretrained PyTorch model


**Output**:


- Preprocessed CT volume (normalized and resampled)
- Visualization of CT slice and predicted nodule overlay


**Details**:


DICOM slices are loaded and stacked into a 3D volume. Clinical lung windowing is applied (center = -600, width = 1500), followed by normalization and resampling to standard voxel size.


---


### 2. Nodule Segmentation and Inference


**Arguments**:


- `img_tensor` : Preprocessed 3D tensor `[1, 1, D, H, W]`
- `model_path` : Path to `.pt` PyTorch model


**Output**:


- Binary mask (`1 = nodule`, `0 = background`)


**Details**:


The input CT volume is passed to a pretrained 3D UNet segmentation model. A threshold of 0.5 is applied to output probabilities to produce a binary mask of suspected nodule regions.


---


### 3. Nodule Volume Quantification


**Arguments**:


- `mask_pred` : Binary mask from segmentation
- `spacing` : 3D voxel spacing in mm


**Output**:


- Number of nodules
- Volume of each in mm¬≥
- Visualization of labeled slice


**Details**:


Connected components are labeled using `scipy.ndimage.label`. Each detected nodule's volume is computed by multiplying voxel count by the voxel volume. Results are printed and optionally exported.


Example output:


```
‚úÖ Lung nodules detected
üìå Number of nodules: 3
üìè Nodule volumes (mm¬≥): [52.3, 88.1, 35.4]
